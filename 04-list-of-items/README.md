# List of items exercise

## Setup

This exercise already comes with a project set up. To download the dependent libraries, run the following command:

```
cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```
ng serve
```

## Exercise

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/item-list/item-list.component.ts` to see for which data you need to render a component list.

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/item-list/item-list.component.html` and finish the *ngFor expression and bindings.

Check the browser output for the correct rendering of the list.
