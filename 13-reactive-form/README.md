# Reactive forms exercise

## Setup

This exercise already comes with a project set up. To download the dependent libraries, run the following command:

```
cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```
ng serve
```

## Exercise

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/example-form/example-form.component.ts` and see that there are errors due to the missing
reactive form.

Add the FormGroups and FormControls as specified. Check `exerciseApp/src/app/example-form/example-form.component.html`
to see how the component should be wired.

Check the browser output to see if your form works again!
