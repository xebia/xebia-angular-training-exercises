# Angular HTTP client exercise

## Setup

This exercise already comes with a project set up. To download the dependent libraries, run the following command:

```
cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```
ng serve
```

## Exercise

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/pokemon/pokemon.component.ts` and see where `getPokemon` is called. The structure has been 
shown in the slides before.

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/pokemon.service.ts`. You need to implement the TODOs to make the `getPokemon` method work.

Use your browser to check if the app works.
