# Advanced exercise: inventory app

The goal of this exercise is to get some hands-on experience with Angular in a real setting.

## Functional description

The inventory app allows users to:

- See a list of what's in stock (start with a fake set of items)
- Order the list on title, stock and price
- Paginate the results
- Place an order for an item
- See their 'shopping cart'
- Modify the cart
- Empty the cart
- Submit the cart as an order (just alert)

Screen, component and service design is up to you. Good luck!
