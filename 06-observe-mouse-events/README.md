cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

ng serve
```

## Exercise

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/mouse-observer/mouse-observer.component.html` and see what is rendered in the template.

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/mouse-observer/mouse-observer.component.ts` and implement each TODO.

Browse to the development server to see how your mouse observer is working.
