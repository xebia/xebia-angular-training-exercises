# Component template exercise

## Setup

This exercise already comes with a project set up. To download the dependent libraries, run the following command:

```
cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```
ng serve
```

## Exercise

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/dice-guess/dice-guess.component.ts` to see the component properties.

Open `exerciseApp/src/app/dice-guess/dice-guess.component.html` and fix the two TODOs.

When you're done, play the game in your browser!
