# Angular Testing Library

## Setup

This exercise already comes with a project set up. To download the dependent libraries, run the following command:

```
cd exerciseApp
npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```
ng serve
```

Also: run the tests:

```
ng test
```

## Exercise

Open each `.spec.ts` file for the 5 components under `src/app`. Implement the TODOs based on the Angular testing lib.
